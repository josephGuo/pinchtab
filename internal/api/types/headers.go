// The X-PinchTab-* wire headers that form the CLI/MCP-to-server contract. They
// live here, the leaf both clients and the server import, so a one-character
// drift on one side is a compile error rather than a silent no-op. Request-side
// tags travel in the body instead, because the strip middleware drops inbound
// X-PinchTab-* headers from public clients; these are the response headers
// (Vocab, Tab-Id) and the source tag the trusted hops set.
